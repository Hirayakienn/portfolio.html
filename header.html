            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> My name is John Ver, sometimes people around me also calls me Jv. I lived in Barangay Sumacab Norte Purok 2 Cabanatuan City. My intended course should have been nursing but since my grade 11 average was low, I chose Information Technology instead because I am also educated about computers even though I occasionally struggle with coding HTML, CSS, and C++, all of which I diligently study. I am currently study at NEUST Sumacab Campus.</p>
                <p> I studied Technology Vocational in senior high school, so I'm a bit more experienced in networking, such as CISCO PACKET and LAN CABLE. Also, In grade 12, as part of Work Immersion, we connected Rj45s to Lan Cables and Cleaned the System Unit.  </p>
